# Painted

Painted is a two-player game that a player can win by painting more than a half of tiles on the game board. The game board starts with all sky-blue color. When a player moves on a tile, the tile changes its color (player1: red, player2: green). Last one who visited the tile gets its color. When two player moves to a tile exactly at the same time, the tile goes back to its original color (sky-blue)
